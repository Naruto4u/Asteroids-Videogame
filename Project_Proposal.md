REMIX YOUR GAME! Take the game you chose, and brainstorm 2 ways to change the mechanics of the game.
This could mean changing the game's  layout, number of players, or even how things might move.
(Mechanics - various actions, behaviors, and control mechanisms afforded to the player within a game)

# Project Proposal: [Ship Havoc!]

### Team Members: [Joseph Danik & Luca Beam]
### Client: [The client will be ourselves, since we will most likely create this game later]
### Date: [11/14/24]


## 1. App Idea
Describe your game idea in a few sentences. What is the overall concept of your game?
```
Ship Havoc is a topdown shooter remix of the game asteroids instead of only shooting asteroids with the goal of getting as many points as possible 
your ship is getting attacked in the middle of an asteroid belt enemies rarely drop gold forcing you to choose between attacking the enemys 
pursuing you or harvesting gold by breaking asteroids to buy upgrades. Space can be used to overclock (aka a speed boost)
```
## 2. Target Audience
Who is this game designed for? Be specific—age group, gaming experience, and interests.
```
This game is mainly designed for 10+ however there are no issues with playing under this age it shouldn't require much gaming experience and
this games targets those who like topdown shooters and rouge likes
```

the goal of the project is to amass experience in game development while having it remain fun the finished result will be published on itch
````
## 4. Key Features
List out the main features of your game. What will the game do? Include both gameplay features and any technical requirements.
````
• Single-player mode wave survival.

````
## 5. Success Criteria
What does success look like for this project? How will you know if the game is a hit?
````
A real world program that runs efficiently on most devices, and is entertaining to play for most
people.
````
## 6. Technical Requirements
List any specific technical needs for your game, like the platform it will run on (e.g., PC, mobile, console), controls, or performance requirements.
Example: The game will be developed for PC and should run smoothly at 60 frames per second. It will require keyboard and mouse controls, and there should be an option to save progress at the end of each level.
This proposal will help guide your team as you design and develop the game. Make sure to update it as you get more ideas or if the client has additional requests.
````
This game will run on pc and requires a keyboard and mouse for its controls and really shouldn't need much for performance you are able to save at the end of every round but because it is a rouge like if you lose you will have to restart
